# interpolate-fields
This program interpolates DNS data to a new grid using linear interpolation. It can run and store the interpolated data in a massively-parallel setting using MPI I/O. For now, it assumes two regular Cartesian grids with the file format of [CaNS](https://github.com/p-costa/CaNS). Information about the boundary conditions of the system must be prescribed too. It is a cleaned up version of the routines used to create the initial conditions for particle-laden turbulent channel transport with 10^10 Eulerian grid points.

Fork of https://github.com/p-costa/interpolate-fields for interpolating DNS data. This branch has a subroutine for io of nfld fields from a single checkpoint file, as well as code for io and interpolating 6 fields from a single checkpoint file (e.g., for symmetric stress tensors for VE/EVP fluids) in the main program. This program also reads the domain size, input and output grid sizes, and input and output filenames dynamically from input files which should be placed in exe/; examples of the input file formats can be found in input/. The data directory in which the field files are located should be specified in the variable 'datadir' in the main program app/interpolate-fields.f90.
